Vim-autoread is a plugin to automatically re-read your buffers, as it changes.

It uses Vim 8 feature of async jobs to append new buffer content as it appears.
Internally, it works by running tail -f on a file and the output will be appended
to the buffer, which displays this file.
Note: this needs the command tail in your path (so probably won't work on
Windows).

Since it relies heavily on the |job| feature of Vim, it needs at least Vim
Version 8 to work.

                                                                    *:AutoRead*
:AutoRead[!]    Starts a new async job and will append output to the current
                buffer as it appears in the background. The buffer will be
                scrolled automatically.
                If ! is given, stop auto-reading.
